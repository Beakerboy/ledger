make the menu structure work right
  currently "Ledger", "Transactions", and "Accounts" all appear as top-level items in the Management menu
  "Transactions" and "Accounts" should both be under "Ledger"
get the /admin/accounts/%/transactions View to work properly
  should display transactions that have ledger_entry fields with a matching account id
  split the ledger_entries into two columns: debit/credit (create fake Views field data definitions?)
ledger_entry fields
  validation
    there should be at least two entries
    all entries should balance each other out (equal zero)
  finish "Remove" button functionality for removing single ledger_entry fields
    currently:
      alerts "not yet implemented" when "Remove" is clicked
      text is not a link or a button, just text with a text cursor on mouse over
